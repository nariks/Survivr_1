How does your gem take advantage of Rubyâ€™s metaprogramming capabilities?

The colorizr gem uses the concept of creating dynamic methods using the
:define_method and send method to create all the require methods for the various
colors on the fly. This has helped the code be DRY.

How long did you spend working on this project?
I spent a week to complete this project.

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
The most rewarding challenge was to make the colorizr gem work especially the 
part of creating the dynamic color methods and to make them print in color.

Where do you still have room to grow?
I think I still want to delve deeper into metaprogramming and do more examples
to solidify the concepts.
